# RemoteMemorymodule
Load the evilDLL from socket connection without touch disk



Inspired by @Rvn0xsy and the famous [MemoryModule](https://github.com/fancycode/MemoryModule) project



#### Server

â€‹	Maked a simple socket server via c++ which is called `PigSender`(only work on Linux)

Responsible for processing the request sent by the client and transferring the DLL

#### Client

1. Added a simple anti-simulation method, and receive DLL file from remote Server

2. Finally, simply call MemoryModule

## Usage:

1. Put your DLL on the VPS and specify the file to be sent and the listening port

**Thanks to this excellent "non-landing" technology, you can use this project to reduce the pain of evasion anti-virus in some temporary environments**
